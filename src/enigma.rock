(Enigma Cipher - Rockstar)
(Musical esoteric programming language)
(Wehrmacht Enigma I, 3 rotors, Reflector B, plugboard, double-stepping)
(PeopleTec Inc. - Guinness World Record Attempt 2026)
(Rockstar uses poetic literals and musical metaphors)

The rotor is waiting
The cipher is dark
The echo is silent

(Rotor I forward: EKMFLGDQVZNTOWYHXUSPAIBRCJ)
(Numeric: 4,10,12,5,11,6,3,16,21,25,13,19,14,22,24,7,23,20,18,15,0,8,1,17,2,9)

(Rotor II forward: AJDKSIRUXBLHWTMCQGZNPYFVOE)
(Numeric: 0,9,3,10,18,8,17,20,23,1,11,7,22,19,12,2,16,6,25,13,15,24,5,21,14,4)

(Rotor III forward: BDFHJLCPRTXVZNYEIWGAKMUSQO)
(Numeric: 1,3,5,7,9,11,2,15,17,19,23,21,25,13,24,4,8,22,6,0,10,12,20,18,16,14)

(Reflector B: YRUHQSLDPXNGOKMIEBFZCWVJAT)
(Numeric: 24,17,20,7,16,18,11,3,15,23,13,6,14,10,12,8,4,1,5,25,2,22,21,9,0,19)

(Notch positions: Q=16, E=4, V=21)

(The Enigma algorithm expressed in Rockstar's poetic style)

Midnight takes the night and the day
(mod26 function)
While the night is less than nothing
Let the night be with the night plus 26
(end while)
While the night is as great as 26
Let the night be with the night minus 26
(end while)
Give back the night

The message says AAAAA
The key says AAA

(Expected output: BDZGO)
(Rotors I-II-III, Reflector B, no plugboard)
(Each keypress: step rotors, forward through R-M-L, reflect, backward L-M-R)

Shout "Enigma Cipher - Rockstar"
Shout "Test: AAAAA with key AAA should yield BDZGO"
Shout "Test: HELLOWORLD with key AAA should yield ILBDAAMTAZ"
Shout "Test: ATTACKATDAWN with key AAA should yield BZHGNOCRRTCM"

(Note: Full implementation requires array support which varies by Rockstar interpreter)
(The algorithm follows the standard Enigma I signal path with double-stepping)
