Enigma Polyglot

Proposed record title:
Most programming languages used to implement the same working computer program

Estimated result and unit:
513 distinct programming languages

Supporting evidence:
620 independently written source files implementing the same program.

What it is:
A complete Enigma rotor cipher simulation implemented across hundreds of programming languages. Each implementation performs stateful rotor stepping, reflector mapping, optional plugboard permutations, and reversible encryption/decryption.

Canonical reference:
Algorithm behavior is anchored to the NSA Enigma simulator reference implementation:
https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/enigma-simulator

Measurement:
The record is measured by the number of distinct programming languages with a working implementation. File count is supporting evidence only.

Verification:
Each implementation must match fixed test vectors and required invariants, including authentic stepping behavior and encryption/decryption symmetry.
