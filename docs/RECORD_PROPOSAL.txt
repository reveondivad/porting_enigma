PROPOSED RECORD TITLE
Most programming languages used to implement the same working computer program

PROGRAM DEFINITION
The program is a complete Enigma rotor cipher simulation (stateful rotor stepping, reflector, optional plugboard, reversible encryption/decryption).
Canonical behavior is anchored to:
https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/enigma-simulator

UNIT OF MEASUREMENT
Count of distinct programming languages with a working implementation.

ESTIMATED RESULT
513 distinct programming languages.

INCLUSION RULES
A language counts if:
1) It is a distinct named language environment with its own compiler/interpreter/runtime.
2) The implementation contains the full cipher logic in that language (not a wrapper calling another language).
3) It produces correct outputs for the fixed test vectors.
4) It satisfies required invariants (encryption/decryption symmetry, stepping behavior).

NORMALIZATION RULES (to ensure “one variable” counting)
Do not double-count:
- Numeric suffix variants: e.g., groovy2, zig2, pony3..pony9, vale10..vale13.
- Duplicate alternates with the same base language: enigma_2.* is not additional languages.
- Simple extension aliases that do not represent distinct languages.

BREAKABILITY
Any challenger can break the record by implementing the same defined program in more distinct languages under the same rules and exceeding 513.

VERIFIABILITY
Evidence consists of:
- repository snapshot with all source files
- MANIFEST.csv listing each file and normalized language name
- fixed test vectors with expected outputs
- verification logs (automated where possible)
- independent witness statement confirming count methodology and existence of verification artifacts
